## Design System

All components are documented and displayed on our main documentation page which is rendered with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)

The storybook is structured accordingly. For example:

```
4. Selection // The category
  4.1 Dropdown // The relevant component by their semantic meaning with common example use cases
```
It contains common examples and use cases, accompanied by explanation how and when to use the components.

## Development - StoryBook

1.  Run `npm install` from the project's root directory to install the dependencies.
2.  Run `npm start` and start hacking your project.

## Build - Storybook

1.  Run `npm build` to build your project.
2.  Deploy the build folder to AWS.
